# cumulant2timelag

# System requirements

The cumulant2timelag script was coded in MATLAB (http://www.mathworks.com). The package has been tested on windows 10 Pro systems.

# Run the demo

1) Set the cumulant2timelag script folder as current folder in MATLAB. 
2) Run script “cumulant2time.m”. 
3) Select the test data to calculate the cumulant curve.
4) Expected output would be a plot displaying the 2nd order cumulant as shown in Figure S19e in the manuscript and an excel file that contains the raw data for the plot.
5) Expected run time for demo on a "normal" desktop computer is about 5 minutes.
